The data selection for this work is maize disease detection. This dataset comes from two sources: [Kaggle Plantvillage dataset ](https:///www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahalidev/plantvillage-dataset/data) and [Github PlantDoc dataset](https://github.com/pratikkayal/PlantDoc-Dataset), but simplified to a specific crop type: maize. This dataset is public and part of a [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/smaranjitghose/corn-or-maize-leaf-disease-dataset/data) to classify images of maize leaf diseases, and it has already been "cleaned" with corrupt images removed [1], [2].

For *PlantVillage*, images were captured from a release of 50,000 images of healthy and infected leaves, taken with mobile devices. Regarding *Plant Doc*: According to the [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10317.pdf)  [3], they created a dataset by downloading images from Google Images and Ecosia for accurate plant disease detection in a farm setting. About 20,900 images were collected using scientific and common names of 38 classes mentioned in Mohanty's dataset, detailing the extraction of these images through mobile devices. In the Kaggle competition, it is mentioned that the final dataset is a combination of both sources, but it is unknown what portion comes from each. Additionally, the periodicity of this data is unclear, only known to have been collected 3 years ago, which might influence the current representativeness and applicability of the model.

Prior research on this dataset has led to the development of various classification models, with a particularly prominent one being based on EfficientNetB2 with Transfer Learning. Available in a public Kaggle notebook, this model has achieved an 95% accuracy and has set a benchmark for subsequent studies. However, the notebook in question did not feature an exhaustive exploratory data analysis, an aspect this current study seeks to rectify. Furthermore, this study adheres to the same data augmentation approach and train-test-validation split adopted by the previous model, with the additional goal of improving accuracy across all four disease classes. The[ referenced notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/omreekapon/corn-and-maize-diseases-classification.) is public and available.
